# Type declarations for external libraries
# Python equivalent of TypeScript declare module statements

# Note: In Python, we don't need explicit type declarations for external modules
# like we do in TypeScript. Type information is handled through:
# 1. Library's own type annotations (if available)
# 2. Type stubs in typeshed or @types packages
# 3. py.typed marker files in packages

# For bip66 equivalent functionality, we use btclib or other Bitcoin libraries
# that provide proper Python type annotations natively.
